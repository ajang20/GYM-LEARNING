</script>

//searchQuery function 
This is the function that does the searching and the logging
It will be passed as a callback into the debounce function.
It's then Optimzed in order to search after a certain period and not after every event call.

//Debounce Function 
This is the middle man between the searchQeury and the eventlistener
It optimzes the searchQuery function into the debouncedSearch. 
It gives it the ability to pause and reset the timer and run the event after a certain period of inactivity

//Returned Function
It the one that makes the searchQuery optimized by delaying the search calls.
